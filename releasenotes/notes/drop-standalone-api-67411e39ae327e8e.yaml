deprecations:
  - |
    The following parameters in ``panko::api`` class have been deprecated and
    now have no effect. These parameters will be removed in a future release.

    - ``host``
    - ``port``
    - ``workers``
    - ``max_limit``

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``panko::api`` class no longer supports standalone api service in
    CentOS and Ubuntu, because these 2 distros don't provide standalone api
    service and require that wsgi is used to run the api service.
